# ADXL355_Acceleration
This project involve the use of ADXL355 accelerometer sensor to measure the distance traveled. The analog signal conditioner circuit is implemented with 2 op amps in subtractor amplifier and lowpass filter configuration. The signal is then digitally processed by Microcontroller.
